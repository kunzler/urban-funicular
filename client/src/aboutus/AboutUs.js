          Frank, Bob and Stan all met in the dungeons of Kalimdor. After a
          tireless campaign they were on the verge of defeating the Lich King. However,fate was not on their side. In a last ditch effort to escape,  the Lich
          King created a portal to another world. The three heroes were trapped in
          the portals vortex and transported to another world. This world...
          Unfortunately, this world did not need heroes with swords and magic. What it did
          need is a used tome & scroll store. The heroes started Frank, Bob and Stan's Tome & Scroll
          Store! They spent all their gold on the store but realized they needed a
          way to catalog all their books. They contacted three experts in the
          field known as Jeff, Chris and Kevin. These three agreed to build a book
          inventory program in exchange for some good pixie dust.
